char represents 8 bits 
with an 8 bit char we can represent 2^8 different things, 2 representing 0s and 1s. 
char16_t : 16 bits
chat32_t: 32 bits 

signed integer takes on negative and positive values and one of the bits decides if it is - or +
a 256 different values on a signed integer will start from -127 to +127 
a 256 different values on an UNSIGNED integer will start from 0 to 256 

Basic float is 32 bits; double is 64 bits and long double is 116 bytes, 
taking it more memory but providing more precicion.
We can use the siteof operator to find out the size of different character types

NOTE: to create an object, we need to call the constructor.

1. We are first looking at the types of data in the dataset to represent. We are first looking
at representing numbers. We have decided to use double instead of float. This is for price and amount.
This decision has been made as we are dealing with financial data and precision matters a lot. with
float, we may not have much precicion as due to lots of multiplication as the result of operations, 
we may lose precicion. So, we would better go with double if dealing with financial data. 

2. Strings, as datatypes, are actually classes. We use strings to represent timestamp, string to represent 
product (BTC/DOGE) and we have decided to use enum class ( a mini namespace) to represent orderType as it can 
take a limited number of values just as bid, ask, etc. 

NOTE: this is best to put ecum classes in the header files. 

3. Now, we need to represent more than one order book entry, which comes in the row format. This is done via
using a vector, which is part of the standard library. 

NOTE: a vector can ONLY store one data type; each datatype needing its own vector. 

4. we pushback data into the vectors. 

NOTE: a class is a way of organizing data and functions that are related to each other into one collection of data
